        Run the local agent with the given query.

        Args:
            query (str): The query to run.
            initiating_agent (bool): Whether this is the agent that initiated the task or not. Can be helpful in using crafted prompts for the underlying model(s)
            agent_instance (LocalAgent, optional): An instance of LocalAgent to use.
            If provided, the agent class will not be reinitialized.
            We recommend not reusing agent classes, as most libraries attach minimal overhead to local agent wrappers, and reusing them can increase the attack surface for prompt injection and data leakage (as well as increase context window length).
